 Cookies and Oat Milk

 You might need...
 a plate, a glass, your favorite cookies (or whatever cookies you might have), and some cold Oat Milk.

 First, put the cookies onto the plate. Don't crowd the plate, you can always get more! Next, pour the cold oat milk into the glass. Now you can enjoy those cookies!
