2 tsp lime juice
2 tsp vegetable oil
75g Greek yoghurt
(full fat)

### Makhani Sauce

20g garlic
(5-6 cloves, grated or finely diced)
15g garlic
(3-4 cloves, finely sliced)
175ml vegetable oil
(or less, see intro)
20g ginger
(grated or finely diced)
2 tins chopped tomatoes
(800g)
2 fresh bay leaves
6 green cardamom pods
2 black cardamom pods
2 cinnamon sticks
2 tsp fine sea salt
1 ½ tsp deggi mirch chilli powder
(or ¾ teaspoon regular chilli powder)
30g unsalted butter
1 tsp garam masala
20g sugar
1 tsp honey
1 tsp ground cumin
1 tsp dried fenugreek leaves
(crushed to a powder between your fingers)
½ tsp fresh dill fronds
80ml double cream

## Method
1. Chicken marinade For the marinade, blitz 10g of ginger, 20g of garlic, 5g of fine sea salt, 1 teaspoon of deggi mirch chilli powder, 1½ teaspoons of ground cumin, ½ teaspoon of garam masala, 2 teaspoons of lime juice, 2 teaspoons of vegetable oil and 75g of full-fat Greek yoghurt in a blender or small food processor.
2. Place 700g of chicken thighs (cut into 4cm chunks) into a bowl and add the marinade. Coat the chicken well and refrigerate for 6-24 hours.
3. Makhani sauce Place a large saucepan over a medium heat and add 175ml of vegetable oil (or less, see intro). Add 15g of sliced garlic and fry until it just starts to turn golden and crispy. Remove the garlic with a slotted spoon and drain on some kitchen paper.
4. Blend 800g of tomatoes to a fine consistency using a stick blender or food processor.
Add 2 bay leaves, 6 green cardamom pods, 2 black cardamom pods and 2 cinnamon sticks to the saucepan with the oil and allow them to crackle for 1 minute, stirring regularly.
5. Turn the heat under the saucepan down low and add 20g of grated garlic and 20g of grated ginger. Allow both to colour but be careful that they don’t burn.
6. Add the blended tomatoes, 2 teaspoons of salt and 1½ teaspoons of deggi mirch chilli powder to the saucepan. Bring to a bubble and cook for around 30 minutes until the sauce has reduced by about half. Stir regularly to make sure it doesn't catch.
7. Add 30g of butter and simmer for 5 minutes.
8. Add 1 teaspoon of garam masala, 20g of sugar, 1 tablespoon of runny honey, 1 teaspoon of ground cumin, the crispy sliced garlic (fried earlier), 1 teaspoon of crushed fenugreek leaves and ½ teaspoon of fresh dill fronds to the saucepan. Cook for another 15 minutes.
9. If using the makhani sauce immediately, add 80ml of double cream and simmer for 5 minutes. If using later, cool the sauce and refrigerate it, adding the cream when you want to reheat it.
10. Chicken Heat a grill to a medium high heat. Place the marinated chicken onto a rack and brush with 20g of melted butter. Grill for around 10-15 minutes, turning once, until the chicken is charred and cooked through.
11. Place a large saucepan over a low to medium heat. Add the makhani sauce, 50ml of double cream and the grilled chicken. Simmer gently for 10 minutes.
12. To serve, transfer to a bowl and top with ginger matchsticks, a small handful of chopped coriander and 1 tablespoon of pomegranate seeds.
